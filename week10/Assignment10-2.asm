#       A given list of n numbers can be sorted in
#   ascending order as follows.
#       Find a largest number in the list (there may be
#   more than one) and swap it with the last
#   element in the list. The new last element is
#   now in its proper position in sorted order.
#       Now, sort the remaining n-1 elements using
#   the same step repeatedly. When only one
#   element is left, sorting is complete. This
#   method is known as *selection sort.*
