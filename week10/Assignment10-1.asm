#    Consider a list of integers of length n. A prefix of
# length I for the given list consist of the first i
# integers in the list, where i[0,n].
#    A maximum-sum prefix, as the name implies, is a
# prefix for which the sum of elements is the largest
# among all prefixes.
#    For example, if the list is (2,-3,2,5,-4), its
# maximum-sum prefix consists of the first four
# elements and the associated sum is 2-3+2+5=6;
# no other prefix of the given list has a larger sum
#    The following procedure uses indexing
# method to find the maximum-sum prefix in a
# list of integers. Read this procedure carefully,
# especially indexing method
