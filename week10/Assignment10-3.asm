# Write a program to find prime numbers from 3 to n in
# a loop by dividing the number n by all numbers from
# 2...n/2 in an inner loop.
# - Using the remainder (rem) operation, determine if n
#   is divisible by any number.
# - If n is divisible, leave the inner loop.
# - If the limit of n/2 is reached and the inner loop has
#   not been exited, the number is prime and you
#   should output the number.
# - So if the user were to enter 25, your program would
#   print out "2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23".
